NextJS is a **framework for ReactJS**.

Wait a second ... a "framework" for React? Isn't React itself already a framework for JavaScript?

Well ... first of all, React is a "library" for JavaScript. That seems to be important for some people.

Not for me, but still, there is a valid point: React already is a framework / library for JavaScript. So it's already an extra layer on top of JS.

## Why would we then need NextJS?

Because NextJS makes building React `import React from 'react'` apps easier - especially React apps that should have server-side rendering (though it does way more than just take care of that).

```js
const greet = () => {
  // This is a comment
  console.log('Welcome!')
}
```

In this article, we'll dive into the core concepts and features NextJS has to offer:

- File-based Routing
- Built-in Page Pre-rendering
- Rich Data Fetching Capabilities
- Image Optimization
- Much More

## File-based Routing

> A block quote with ~strikethrough~

- Lists
- [ ] todo
- [x] done

A table:

| city    | mls     |
| ------- | ------- |
| Toronto | C123456 |

... More content ...

export default ({ children }) => {
  return <NoteLayout meta={meta}>{children}</NoteLayout>
}
